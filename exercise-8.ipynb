    "Now that we have a set of nuclear objects labeled in each frame, cell tracking can be framed simply as a problem of connecting objects in frame $n$ to objects in frame $n+1$. However we need to also deal with the possibility that cells can die or divide into new daughter cells. In order to accomodate this complication, we have adapted a linear assignment framework first introduced by Jaqaman et al (2008). The goal of the linear assignment algorithm is to select a set of pairs such that the sum of the selected weights is minimized. In the framework established by Jaqaman et al, the cost matrix is divided into four quadrants. The top left and bottom right corners correspond to direct matches between objects in frame n to objects in frame $n+1$. The bottom left corner is populated by a diagonal matrix where diagonal values correspond to the probability of a cell dividing. The top right corner is filled with another diagonal matrix in which the diagonal values correspond to the probability of cell death. A diagram of the cost matrix is shown below. \n",
